### HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
- HTML is the markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web. In this HTML document:

- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies the document type and version.
- <html> is the root element, and lang="en" indicates that the document is in English.
- <head> contains metadata about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and links to external resources.
- <body> contains the visible content of the webpage.
### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
- CSS is a style sheet language used for describing how HTML elements should be displayed on the web. In this CSS code:
- The body selector applies styles to the entire document, setting the background color and centering content vertically and horizontally.
- The .container class styles a container div within the body, giving it a white background, border-radius, and box shadow.
- <h1> elements are styled with a specific font size, color, and margin.
- The #info-card selector styles the card that displays user information.
- .field and .label classes style the user information fields and labels.
#user-info span selector styles the user information text.
### JavaScript:
- JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages. In this JavaScript code:
 - It checks if user information is already stored in the browser's local storage using localStorage.getItem.
- If user information exists, it retrieves and displays it in the HTML document.
- The storeUserInfo function collects user information through prompts and stores it in local storage as a JSON string using localStorage.setItem.
- After storing the user information, it updates the displayed user information in the HTML document.
- Overall, this combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creates a simple web page where users can enter their personal information, and that information is stored locally and displayed on the page. This allows users to see their information even after refreshing or revisiting the webpage.
